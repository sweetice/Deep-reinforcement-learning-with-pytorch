## Deep-reinforcement-learning-with-pytorch

**Status:** 
Active (under active development, breaking changes may occur)

This repository will implement the classic and state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The aim of this repository is to provide clear pytorch code for people to learn the deep reinforcement learning algorithm. 

In the future, more state-of-the-art algorithms will be added and the existing codes will also be maintained.

## DQN

Here I uploaded two DQN models which is trianing CartPole-v0 and MountainCar-v0.

### Tips for MountainCar-v0

This is a sparse binary reward task. Only when car reach the top of the mountain there is a none-zero reward. In genearal it may take 1e5 steps in stochastic policy. You can add a reward term, for example, to change to the current position of the Car is positively related. Of course, there is a more advanced approach that is inverse reinforcement learning.

![step](https://github.com/sweetice/Deep-reinforcement-learning-with-pytorch/blob/master/Char01%20DQN/DQN/pic/finish_episode.jpg) 
This is value loss for DQN, We can see that the loss increaded to 1e13, however, the network work well. Because the target_net and act_net are very different with the training process going on. The calculated loss cumulate large. The previous loss was small because the reward was very sparse, resulting in a small update of the two networks.

## Policy Gradient


Use the following command to run a saved model


```
python Run_Model.py
```


Use the following command to train model


```
python pytorch_MountainCar-v0.py
```



> policyNet.pkl

This is a model that I have trained.


## Actor-Critic

This is an algorithmic framework, and the classic REINFORCE method is stored under Actor-Critic.

## A2C

Advantage Policy Gradient, an paper in 2017 pointed out that the difference in performance between A2C and A3C is not obvious.

The Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic method (A3C) has been very influential since the paper was published. The algorithm combines a few key ideas:

- An updating scheme that operates on fixed-length segments of experience (say, 20 timesteps) and uses these segments to compute estimators of the returns and advantage function.
- Architectures that share layers between the policy and value function.
- Asynchronous updates.
